# Chance-Constrained Sequential Convex Programming

## UP branch

This repository contains a chance-constrained sequential convex programming algorithm, used to compute approximately robust trajectories with a *[sampling-based reachability analysis algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10180)* based on random set theory.

Based on our ECC 2020 paper *[Chance-Constrained Sequential Convex Programming for Robust Trajectory Optimization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9143595)*.
